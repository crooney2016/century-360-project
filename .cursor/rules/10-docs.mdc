### Purpose

Documentation standards for TSDoc and TypeDoc, aligned with strict linting.

### TSDoc Requirements

- Public functions, React components, hooks, and utilities must include TSDoc.
- Describe purpose, params, returns, edge cases, and side-effects.
- Keep comments concise and match Prettier formatting to avoid lint issues.

### TypeDoc

- Generate: `pnpm ui:docs` (outputs to `public/typedoc/`).
- Embed docs via `scripts/typedoc-embed.mjs` for UI visibility.

### Authoring Guidelines

- Prefer examples over prose for usage patterns.
- Keep API contracts in sync with `graphql/schema.ts`. Update docs when the schema changes.
- Update README and domain docs when adding major features.

### PR Checklist

- Added/updated TSDoc where applicable
- Updated TypeDoc if public APIs changed
- Kept examples minimal but runnable
