### Purpose

Provide a lightweight ADR (Architecture Decision Record) process to guide major choices.

### When To Create An ADR

- Breaking API changes, data model changes, or cross-cutting architectural shifts
- Dependency swaps/upgrades that affect many modules
- Security posture or compliance changes

### ADR Template

Copy into `docs/architecture/` as `ADR-YYYYMMDD-short-title.md`.

```
# Title

## Context
What problem are we solving? Constraints and requirements.

## Options Considered
- Option A
- Option B
- Option C

## Decision
Chosen option and rationale.

## Consequences
Positive, negative, and risks. Rollback plan.

## Implementation Notes
Milestones, owners, and validation plan (tests, benchmarks).
```

### Governance

- Major decisions require user approval before implementation.
- Record follow-ups and revisit dates if the decision is provisional.
