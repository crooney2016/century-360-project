# Wizard (Archived)

This folder previously contained an unimplemented feature stub. It was archived to keep `src/lib/` limited to active utilities and business services per our architecture rules. Restore only when a wizard feature is designed, approved, and scheduled.

- Rationale: adhere to module boundaries and avoid shipping dead code.
- Impact: no runtime references were found; no functional change.
